## Projects Overview

### **Anchor AMM** (`anchor-amm/`)
An Automated Market Maker (AMM) implementation similar to Uniswap, built on Solana.

**Key Features:**
- Liquidity pool creation and management
- Token swapping mechanisms
- Liquidity provider rewards
- Price calculation algorithms

**Technologies:** Rust, Anchor Framework, Solana Program Library (SPL)

---

### **NFT Staking Platform** (`anchor-nft-staking/`)
A comprehensive NFT staking solution with reward distribution mechanisms.

**Key Features:**
- Stake NFTs to earn token rewards
- Flexible staking periods
- Reward calculation and distribution
- Unstaking functionality with proper validation

**Technologies:** Rust, Anchor, Metaplex, SPL Token

---

###  **Escrow Smart Contract** (`anchor-escrow/`)
A secure escrow system for peer-to-peer transactions on Solana.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-party transaction security
- Automated fund release conditions
- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- Gas-efficient implementation

**Technologies:** Rust, Anchor Framework, Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)

---

###  **Token Vault System** (`anchor-vault/`)
A secure token management and vault system for institutional use.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-signature wallet functionality
- Role-based access control
- Batch transaction processing
- Audit trail and logging

**Technologies:** Rust, Anchor, SPL Token, Solana CLI

---

###  **Solana Starter Projects** (`solana-starter/`)
Foundation projects covering Solana basics and fundamental concepts.

**Includes:**
- Basic program deployment
- Account management
- Transaction handling
- Client-side integration examples

##  Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose | Proficiency |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Rust** | Smart contract development | Advanced |
| **Anchor Framework** | Solana program development | Advanced |
| **TypeScript** | Client-side development | Intermediate |
| **Solana CLI** | Deployment and testing | Advanced |
| **SPL Token** | Token operations | Advanced |
| **Metaplex** | NFT standards | Intermediate |
| **Node.js** | Testing and scripting | Intermediate |

##  Key Learning Outcomes

Through this cohort, I have developed expertise in:

-  **Solana Program Development**: Writing secure and efficient smart contracts in Rust
-  **Anchor Framework Mastery**: Leveraging Anchor for rapid development and testing
-  **DeFi Protocol Implementation**: Building AMMs, staking, and lending protocols
-  **NFT Ecosystem Development**: Creating and managing NFT marketplaces and utilities
-  **Security Best Practices**: Implementing secure coding patterns and audit practices
-  **Cross-Program Invocations (CPI)**: Building composable programs
-  **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Advanced account management
-  **Client Integration**: Connecting frontend applications to Solana programs

##  Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **Solana CLI** (v1.14+)

- **Node.js** (v16+)
- **Yarn** or **npm**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/solana-turbin3/Q3_25_Builder_AYUSHSONI.git
   cd Q3_25_Builder_AYUSHSONI
   ```

2. **Install Solana CLI**
   ```bash
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.14.29/install)"
   ```

3. **Install Anchor CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @coral-xyz/anchor-cli
   ```

4. **Set up Solana configuration**

   solana-keygen new
   ```

## Running the Projects

### For Anchor Projects (AMM, NFT Staking, Escrow, Vault):

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd anchor-[project-name]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the program
anchor build

# Deploy to localnet
anchor deploy

# Run tests
anchor test
```

### For Basic Solana Projects:

```bash
# Navigate to solana-starter
cd solana-starter

# Build the program
cargo build-bpf

# Deploy the program
solana program deploy target/deploy/[program_name].so

# Run client tests
npm test
```
